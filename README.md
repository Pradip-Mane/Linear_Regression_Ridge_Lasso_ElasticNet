Problem Statement
- The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

- Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

Hypothesis Generation
- Make it a practice to do this before solving any ML problem. Ideally,before seeing the data or else, you might end up with biased hypotheses.

What could affect the target variable (sales)?

1.Time of week : Weekends usually are more busy
2.Time of day : Higher sales in the mornings and late evenings
3.Time of year : Higher sales at end of the year
4.Store size and location
5.Items with more shelf space
